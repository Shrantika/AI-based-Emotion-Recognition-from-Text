# AI-based-Emotion-Recognition-from-Text
Machine learning project that classifies emotions in text using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.

~ This project is a Machine Learning-based Emotion Classification system that predicts the emotion expressed in a tweet.
It uses traditional NLP preprocessing + TF-IDF + Logistic Regression to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, etc.

~ This project aims to build a simple but effective emotion detection model using classical ML.
* It includes the full pipeline:
* Load the dataset (Tweet Emotion Dataset)
* Clean and preprocess text
* Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
* Train a Logistic Regression classifier
* Evaluate performance using accuracy + classification report
* Predict emotions for custom input text
